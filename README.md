# RiffMaker!!!

RiffMaker is a mobile app built to help musicians quickly capture, organize and revisit riff ideas — without losing inspiration.

Designed to be fast, offline-first and distraction-free.

## Features
- Create and store riffs
- BPM, tuning and notes
- Edit riffs
- Swipe to delete
- Offline-first (no account needed)
- Clean, dark-themed UI

## Tech Stack
- Expo
- React Native
- TypeScript
- AsyncStorage
- Expo Router

## Status
**v1.0.0** — MVP complete  
Future versions will include audio recording and playback.

## Motivation
Musicians often lose ideas because opening a DAW is slow and distracting.  
RiffMaker focuses on capturing the idea first — production comes later.
